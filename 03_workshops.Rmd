[Full description](http://user2016.org/tutorials/01.html) on the main useR! website  

### Pre-tutorial set-up

**It is vital that you attempt to set up your system in advance. You cannot show up at 9am with no preparation and keep up!**

These are battle-tested instructions, so most will succeed. We believe in you! If you have trouble, you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r/issues) and we *might* be able to help in the days leading up to useR! (no promises). We will have TAs in the room starting at 8:15am and throughout the workshop.

Try this. Give it about 1 - 2 hours. If you hit a wall, we will help:

  * Register a free GitHub account (chapter \@ref(github-acct)).
  * Install or update R and RStudio (chapter \@ref(install-r-rstudio)).
  * Install Git (chapter \@ref(install-git)).
  * Introduce yourself to Git (chapter \@ref(hello-git)).
  * Prove local Git can talk to GitHub (chapter \@ref(push-pull-github)).
  * Cache your username and password (chapter \@ref(credential-caching)) or set up SSH keys (chapter \@ref(ssh-keys)) so you don't need to authenticate yourself to GitHub interactively *ad nauseum*.
  * Prove RStudio can find local Git and, therefore, can talk to GitHub (chapter \@ref(rstudio-git-github)).
    - FYI: this is where our hands-on activities will start. We walk through a similar activity together, with narrative, and build from there.

Troubleshooting:

  * If RStudio is having a hard time finding Git, see chapter \@ref(rstudio-see-git).
  * For all manner of problems, both installation and usage related, see chapter \@ref(troubleshooting).
  
Optional reading on "big picture stuff":

  * Read "Why Git? Why GitHub?" in chapter \@ref(big-picture).
    
### What we can do together

  * Verify and complete the most difficult part: installation and configuration!
  * Create a Git repository and connect the local repo to a GitHub remote, for new and existing projects.
  * Run R code, via R Markdown or a script, and share a presentable report via GitHub.
  * The intersection of GitHub and the R world:
    - R packages developed on Github and how to make use of [Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
    - [METACRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org) [read-only mirror](https://github.com/cran) of all of CRAN + R-specific searching tips.
  * Propose a change to someone else's project, i.e. "make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)".
  * Discuss daily workflow:
    - How often should I commit? Which files should I commit?
    - Data files and the dilemmas they present.
    - Most common Git predicaments. How to avoid and recover.
    - How do groups of 1, 5, or 10 people structure their work with Git(Hub)?
