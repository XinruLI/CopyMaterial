## More about R and RStudio

**Get current, people.** You don't want to adopt new things on day one. But at some point, running old versions of software adds unnecessary difficulty.

In live workshops, there is a limit to how much we can help with ancient versions of R or RStudio. Also, frankly, there is a limit to our motivation. By definition, these problems are going away and we'd rather focus on edge cases with current versions, which affect lots of people.
